<img src="images/US%20States%20by%20Priority%20Level.png?raw=true"/>
- Problem: The US has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Vulnerable populations develop serious complications
and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. It is hard to understand which states
and hospitals should be prioritized when designing staff plans.
- Objective: Determine the priority states to staff, based on historical data
from 2009-2017.
- Client: A medical staffing agency covering all hospitals in the 50 US states
wants help to build a staffing plan for next year’s influenza season.
- Context: This project was completed in the context of Career Foundry’s
Data Analytics Program. The data is real, but the scenario and agency are
fictitious.
- Skills: Data cleaning, wrangling and analysis in Excel. Visualizations in
Tableau
